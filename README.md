Chronic Kidney Disease Binary Classification


This project was emailed to me as an initial screening test for Wemanity Group.


### Assignment

You must generate an application that can be used across biomedical data science projects.  The dataset used for the proof of concept can help physicians better understand chronic kidney disease (CKD) using numerous measurements and biomarkers that have been collected.


### Data Set

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease#

This data set was made public in 2015, the result of a study done in Tamilnadu, India.  It contains 24 independent variables -- features of a patient's blood -- which we can use to indicate the dependent variable "class".  Class is a binary value which indicates that a patient does or does not have Chronic Kidney Disease.

This data contains null values, and it does not have standardized data types.  It is provided for free by University of California Irvine (whoo! go Aardvarks!) in a .rar archive, with all relevant information in .arff.


### Usage Instructions

You can follow the process from decompression to prediction in the Jupyter notebook "presentation.ipynb" or use the script provided to simply predict a value.
